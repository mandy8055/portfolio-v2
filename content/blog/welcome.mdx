# Welcome to My New Portfolio

I'm excited to launch my new portfolio built with **Next.js 15**! This marks a significant upgrade from my previous Jekyll-based site.

## Why Next.js?

After working extensively with React and Next.js professionally, I wanted my portfolio to reflect my expertise with modern web technologies:

- ⚡ **Performance**: Server Components and optimized rendering
- 🎨 **Modern Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- 📝 **MDX Support**: Write blog posts with JSX components
- 🌙 **Dark Mode**: Built-in theme support
- 🎯 **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration

## What to Expect

Starting in 2026, I'm committing to publishing **1 blog post per week** covering:

- React & Next.js best practices
- Web performance optimization
- TypeScript tips and patterns
- Career growth in tech
- Open source contributions

## Tech Stack

This portfolio is built with:

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4
- MDX for blog posts
- Framer Motion for animations
- Deployed on Vercel
